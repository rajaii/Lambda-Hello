Hi,
I am Ali Rajaii.  

	I am a student at LAMBDA School.  I like to program apps, I do Brazilian JuJitsu, and I play guitar.  I also love to engage in mystics and spirituality.  My goal in life is to attain samadhi.  

	Professionally I was an entrepreneur; I had a small company that did alright but I decided that tech is the way to go.  I studied psychology (BS) and finance (MS) at Colorado State and Florida International University, respectively. Computer science is both creative and intellectually fulfilling, and will do well for my next job and venture.  Here I am at LAMBDA.
